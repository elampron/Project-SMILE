feat: Clean up smiles_chest and enhance chat UI scrolling

- Removed outdated files and directories from smiles_chest to prepare for a new structure.
- Updated chat interface to include inner scrolling, preventing the whole page from scrolling.
- Adjusted the message area to have a fixed height and added smooth scrolling to the bottom.
- Changed fetch URL to use the local network name.

P.S. Smiles is watching over this repo, adding a sprinkle of AI magic! ðŸŒŸ
