Eric and I discussed several improvements and tools to enhance my capabilities. We planned to finalize the save_document tool, add an Open URL tool for browsing web pages, and implement multi-modal capabilities for sending images and documents. Eric also mentioned a preference for local Montreal time, which I noted as a priority. We attempted to run the memory agent successfully, and Eric expressed interest in testing the save_document tool.
